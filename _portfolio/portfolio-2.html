Proposes a DL-based algorithm which is used for improving the performance of digit detection 
from IoT-based analog water meters. The DL algorithm is trained on a rich dataset of over 160,000 images 
collected from six water nodes deployed at locations with different environmental conditions. A detailed comparison 
between the proposed DL and ML algorithm is made based on detection accuracy, feature analysis, error analysis, and 
computational complexity analysis. It is observed that compared to the ML model, the proposed DL model maintained a higher 
detection accuracy and is more generalized in terms of feature extraction. 

Implemented the OpenCV EAST text detector in an effort to make the algorithm more robust and generalized.
Successfully implemented the algorithm for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures of the IOT.
