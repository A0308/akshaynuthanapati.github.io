Hello there! I am Akshay, a recent graduate from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal. I currently work as an ML Engineer at ZenTree Labs. I possess varying degrees of interests in the fields of Machine Learning, Computational Science and the study of Intelligence. My past research experience covers a multitude of areas ranging from Computer Vision to Cognitive Science to Large Language Models. 

Of late I have been fascinated by the Transformer Architecture. I believe we are going to live through the creation of AGI. It will be the most significant event in the history of the world and Transformers bring us one step closer to solving the intricate puzzle of intelligence. 

I'm currently involved in a research project working with [Bharat Ramsundar](https://rbharath.github.io/about/) (Stanford PhD, Founder of Deep Forest Sciences) on integrating Neural Operators into Chemical Language Models. I have also co-authored a paper on Transformers with [Raj Dandekar](https://rajdandekar.github.io/) (MIT PhD, 2022)

My research interests center around Deep Learning, Transformers and Natural Language Processing.
