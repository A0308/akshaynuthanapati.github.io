Hello there! I am Akshay, a recent graduate from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal. I possess varying degrees of interests in the fields of Machine Learning, Computational Science and the study of Intelligence. My past research experience covers a multitude of areas ranging from Computer Vision to Cognitive Science to Chemical Language Models. 

Of late I have been fascinated by the Transformer Architecture. I believe we are going to live through the creation of AGI. It will be the most significant event in the history of the world and Transformers probably constitute one of the many pieces of the intricate puzzle yet to be solved.
